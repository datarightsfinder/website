    <h2>About Data Rights Finder</h2>

    <p><span class="semibold">Let's be honest. We've all agreed to privacy policies we haven't read or understood.</span> And when we do have an issue we want to resolve, not many of us know what to do.</p>

    <p>Organisations should make their privacy policies easy to understand. But not all of them do. To help with this problem, <span class="semibold">we've analysed organisations' privacy policies</span> to make it clearer how they use data, including data about you.</p>

    <p><span class="semibold">And we're making it easier to know what your rights are</span> if you want to use any of your data protection rights. <span class="semibold">We'll guide you through making requests</span> to change how data about you is used.</p>

    <p>Currently, we're focussing on covering <span class="semibold">fintech organisations</span>. We'll be expanding our coverage in the future. <a href="mailto:contact@datarightsfinder.org">Let us know at contact@datarightsfinder.org</a> if there's a specific organisation you'd like to be added to the site</p>
